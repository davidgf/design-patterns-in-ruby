# Domain-Specific Language Pattern

## Problem
We want to build a convenient syntax for solving problems of a specific domain.

## Solution
Ruby is really flexible and has human friendly syntaxâ€” sometimes reading a piece of Ruby code even feels like reading a book. **The Domain-Specific Language (DSL)** pattern takes advantage of this and suggests building a new language on top of Ruby. It starts by building data structures that hold the information about the tasks to be performed. Then, it defines several top-level methods that support the DSL and allow the end user to build a program with the newly created language. Finally, the program is evaluated and interpreted as Ruby method calls.

## Example
We want to provide a simple way to create periodic backups of certain folders. We can easily do so with Ruby, but our end users might not know anything about programming so we'll build a DSL for them. First, we need to set up some data structures:

```ruby
class Backup
  include Singleton

  attr_accessor :backup_directory, :interval
  attr_reader :data_sources
  
  def initialize
    @data_sources = []
    @backup_directory = '/backup'
    @interval = 60
  end

  def backup_files
    this_backup_dir = Time.new.ctime.tr(' :','_')
    this_backup_path = File.join(backup_directory, this_backup_dir)
    @data_sources.each {|source| source.backup(this_backup_path)}
  end

  def run
    while true
      backup_files
      sleep(@interval*60)
    end
  end
end

class DataSource
  attr_reader :directory, :finder_expression

  def initialize(directory, finder_expression)
    @directory = directory
    @finder_expression = finder_expression
  end

  def backup(backup_directory)
    files=@finder_expression.evaluate(@directory)
    files.each do |file|
      backup_file( file, backup_directory)
    end
  end

  def backup_file( path, backup_directory)
    copy_path = File.join(backup_directory, path)
    FileUtils.mkdir_p( File.dirname(copy_path) )
    FileUtils.cp( path, copy_path)
  end
end
```

The `Backup` class holds the information about the directories to be backed up and a method to perform the backup. The `DataSource` class is a container for a path to a directory and has file finding capabilities. The only thing left is the top-level methods that will make use of the data structures and will let the end user define their program:

```ruby
def backup(dir, find_expression=All.new)
  Backup.instance.data_sources << DataSource.new(dir, find_expression)
end

def to(backup_directory)
  Backup.instance.backup_directory = backup_directory
end

def interval(minutes)
  Backup.instance.interval = minutes
end

eval(File.read('backup.pr'))
Backup.instance.run
```

It's a pretty simple language: the `backup` method sets the directories to be backed up, the `to` method sets the destination folder of the copy, and the `interval` method sets how often the copy will be performed. Then, the program created by the end user is read and interpreted as Ruby code with `eval`.What does a program created with our DSL look like? Pretty simple:

```ruby
backup '/home/russ/documents'

backup '/home/russ/music', file_name('*.mp3') & file_name('*.wav')

backup '/home/russ/images', except(file_name('*.tmp'))

to '/external_drive/backups'

interval 60
```

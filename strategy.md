# Strategy Pattern

## Problem
We need to vary part of an algorithm— something we previously solved using the Template Method pattern— although we want to avoid its drawbacks, introduced by the fact that it's built around inheritance.

## Solution
To avoid problems introduced by inheritance we should use delegation. Instead of creating subclasses (like in the Template Method pattern), we tear out the varying part of the code and isolate it in its own class and create one of them for each variation. The key idea of the Strategy pattern is to define a family of objects (strategies), which all do (almost) the same thing and support the same interface. Then, the user of the strategy (context) can treat the strategies as interchangeable parts.

## Example
Following the example of the Template Method pattern, we can refactor the code so that every format is a class (strategy), instead of a subclass. That way, the Report class would become much simpler, it would play the context object role and would be provided with the strategy.

```ruby
class Report
  attr_reader :title, :text
  attr_accessor :formatter

  def initialize(formatter)
    @title = 'Monthly Report'
    @text = ['Things are going', 'really, really well.']
    @formatter = formatter
  end

  def output_report
    @formatter.output_report(self)
  end
end
```

The implementation of every format would have its own class, which allows us to achieve a better separation of concerns.

```ruby
class HTMLFormatter
  def output_report(context)
    puts('<html>')
    puts(' <head>')
    puts("<title>#{context.title}</title>")
    puts(' </head>')
    puts(' <body>')
    context.text.each do |line|
      puts("<p>#{line}</p>")
    end
    puts(' </body>')
    puts('</html>')
  end
end

class PlainTextFormatter
  def output_report(context)
    puts("***** #{context.title} *****")
    context.text.each do |line|
      puts(line)
    end
  end
end
```

To use it, we just provide a formated object (strategy) to the report (context)

```ruby
report = Report.new(HTMLFormatter.new)
report.output_report

report.formatter = PlainTextFormatter.new
report.output_report
```
